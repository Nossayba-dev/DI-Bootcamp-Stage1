    <h1>CGI Animated Short Film: "Watermelon A Cautionary Tale" by Kefei Li & Connie Qin He </h1>
    <p>is a playful animated short that takes us back to those wild childhood moments
         when our imaginations ran free and our obsessions—no matter how weird—felt totally real. 
         It follows a little boy who really loves watermelon… maybe a little too much. 
         With colorful visuals and a darkly funny twist, it reminds us of those times when we believed
          the strangest things—and how they sometimes got the best of us.
